# Product Context: rewrite-stars

## Why This Project Exists
GitHub's native starred repositories list is limited in organization and presentation. Power users and developers often star hundreds of repositories, making it difficult to find, categorize, and share their favorites.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of organization for starred repositories
- No way to add custom tags or notes
- Inability to filter or search by custom criteria
- No visually appealing, shareable dashboard

## How It Should Work
- Users authenticate via GitHub SSO
- The app fetches and syncs starred repositories
- Users can add, edit, and manage custom tags
- Repositories are displayed as cards with key info and tags
- Users can filter/search by tags or keywords
- Dashboards can be shared publicly via unique URLs

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, seamless onboarding
- Intuitive tag management and filtering
- Beautiful, responsive UI (mobile-first)
- Delightful interactions and feedback
- Privacy and security by default
